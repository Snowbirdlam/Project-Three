# <Bootcamp-Project-Two>

## Description

I created a password generator to help a user find a secure password for the various login pages that they have to deal with. That way they don't always have to do the heavy lifting of creating a new password every time. 

From this project I learned a lot about javascript and how to better implement its logic and syntax. I also understand better how to order the various elements on the page to ensure the code runs smoothly. There are many other things that I have learned, but these are the main ones. 


## Usage

![alt text]("assets\Screenshot 2023-12-07 120631.png")
The first screenshot shows the default screen, this is what the user sees first. 
![alt text]("assets\Screenshot 2023-12-07 120644.png")
The second screenshot shows the dialog box that pops up after the user clicks the 'generate password' button. It gives the user the option to specify how long they want their password to be so long as it is between 8 to 128 characters. 
![alt text]("assets\Screenshot 2023-12-07 120706.png")
After the user specifies how long they want their password to be, other dialog boxes show up with questions on if they need a number, uppercase, lowercase, or special character in their password. 
![alt text]("assets\Screenshot 2023-12-07 120734.png")
If the user specifies the length of their password to be under 8 characters, it will go into the next dialog box that can be seen in the next screenshot. 
![alt text]("assets\Screenshot 2023-12-07 120759.png")
The user will be notified on the number of characters that are needed in order to generate a password. 
![alt text]("assets\Screenshot 2023-12-07 120809.png")
IF the user does type in the length of password to be under 8 or over 128 characters, after running the code for the dialog box from the previous screenshot, the password generator will return as undefined. 


## Credits

I have been helped by my tutor Andrew Hardemon in figuring out the logic and syntax of the JS script as well as how to format it on the style sheet. I couldn't have been able to get the password to generate and show up on the screen without his help.
